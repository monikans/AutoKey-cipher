## Introducing the AutoKey Cipher

The AutoKey cipher is a substitution cipher that enhances encryption by using a keyword. In this cipher, each letter of the keyword shifts the plaintext letters to produce the ciphertext. While it provides better security than basic substitution ciphers, it can still be vulnerable to certain cryptographic attacks.

### Key Features:
 **Keyword-Based Shifting**: Uses a keyword to determine the shifting pattern for each letter in the plaintext.
 **Enhanced Security**: Offers improved security compared to simple substitution ciphers by varying the shift for each letter.
 **Cryptographic Vulnerabilities**: Although more secure, the AutoKey cipher is susceptible to some types of cryptographic attacks.

The AutoKey cipher is a step up from basic encryption methods, providing better security through the use of a dynamic shifting pattern. However, itâ€™s important to be aware of its potential weaknesses.
